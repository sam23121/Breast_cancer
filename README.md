## General info
A common frustration in the industry, especially when it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, is that the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone. These questions can be similar to:
- “What will happen if I halve the price of my product?”
- “Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?”

the following tasks has been done on the Breas cancer dataset found on kaggle
- Perform a causal inference task using Pearl’s framework;
- Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;
- Merge machine learning with causal inference;?
